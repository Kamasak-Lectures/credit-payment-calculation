To calculate **monthly loan payments** using the **monthly interest rate**, the **annuity formula** is typically used.  
This formula applies to loans with **equal monthly installments** (e.g., mortgage, car, or personal loans).  

---

### 🧮 Formula:
$$A = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}$$

---

### 📘 Variables:
- **A** → Monthly payment (installment amount)  
- **P** → Principal (loan amount)  
- **r** → Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)  
- **n** → Total number of months (loan term)

---

### 📍 Example:
Let’s say:
- Loan amount (**P**) = 100,000 TL  
- Annual interest rate = 24% → **Monthly rate r = 0.24 / 12 = 0.02 (2%)**  
- Term = **24 months**

Plug into the formula:

$$A = 100000 \times \frac{0.02(1 + 0.02)^{24}}{(1 + 0.02)^{24} - 1} $$

Now calculate:

$$A = 100000 \times \frac{0.02 \times 1.6084}{1.6084 - 1} = 100000 \times \frac{0.03217}{0.6084} \approx 5291.75$$

➡️ **Monthly payment ≈ 5,292 TL**

---

### 💡 Additional Info:
- Total repayment: \( 5,292 × 24 = 127,008 TL \)  
- Total interest paid: \( 127,008 - 100,000 = 27,008 TL \)
